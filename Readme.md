to install, and see `example/example.ipynb` to get started.
Also have a look at the documentation and at the main class `Igle`, which is defined in `memtools/igle.py`.


Here, we have adapted the memtools repository slightly for out upcomming paper:

We introduced a new extraction method, see example notebook.
